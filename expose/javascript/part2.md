1. 3, Because the type of i is var, it can be accessed anywhere in the function.
2. 150, Because the type of discountedPrice is var, it can be accessed anywhere in the function.
3. 150, Because the type of finalPrice is var, it can be accessed anywhere in the function.
4. [ 50, 100, 150 ]. The function iterates over each price in the prices list and computes the price after discount and round it.
5. error. Because let keyword provides the variable with what is known as block scope, and line 12 is outside of 'for' block.
6. error. Because let keyword provides the variable with what is known as block scope, and line 13 is outside of 'for' block.
7. 150, Line 14 finalPrice is in the same block as line 4.
8. [ 50, 100, 150 ]. The function iterates over each price in the prices list and computes the price after discount and round it.
9. error. Because let keyword provides the variable with what is known as block scope, and line 11 is outside of 'for' block.
10. Because line 12 length is in the same block as line 4 and its value is not reassigned.
11. [ 50, 100, 150 ]. The function iterates over each price in the prices list and computes the price after discount. The value of all cons variables are not changed in the function. 
12. A. student["name"]. B. student["Grad Year"]. C. student["greeting"]. D. student["Favorite Teacher"]["name"]. E. student["courseLoad"][0]
13. A. "32". When you "add" a number to a string, the number is converted to a string and concatenates both together. B. 1. When you "substract" a string by a number, the string is converted to a number and do the calculation. C. 3. null is converted to 0. D. "3null", null is converted to "null". E. 4. true is converted to 1. F. 0. false is converted to 0 and null is converted to 0. G. "3undefined", undefined is converted to a string and concatenates strings. H. NaN. undefined is converted to number NaN. 
14. A. true. '2' is converted to 2. B. false. compare string in lexicographical order. C. true. '2' is converted to 2. D. false. type is not the same. E. false. true is converted to 1. F. true. 2 is converted to true.
15. == compares the values. === compares the values and types.
17. The modifyArray function iterates over the input array. For each number in the array, it is mutiplied by 2 and saved into newArr. newArr will be returned.
